This Git repo supports my paper __Newton's Method in Three Precisions__

The software is in Julia and I have included 
  - A Jupyter notebook
  - The codes for the examples in the paper
  - A copy of [talk on interprecision transfers](MPArrays_XSDK-MULTIPRECISION_June_15.pdf) for the XSDK-MULTIPRECISION series of seminars
