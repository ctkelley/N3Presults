mplu!(MPA::Union{MPArray,MPEArray})

Plain vanilla MPArray factorization.

The story on interprecision transfers is that 

- MPLFact downcasts the residual before the solve and avoids N^2 
  interprecision transfers. MPLFact factors MPArrays.

- MPLEFact factors MPEArrays and therefore does interprecision transfers 
  on the fly and incurs the N^2 interprecision transfer cost for that. 

  MPLEFact is what you must use if you plan to use the low precision 
  factorization as a preconditioner in IR-GMRES or you're working in 
  Float16 and the matrix is very ill-conditioned. MPLEFact factors 
  MPEArrays, which know to do interprecision transfers on-the-fly.

The 

Union{MPArray,MPEArray}

lets me use the on_the_fly trait to figure out what do to.
