# hlu and hlu! are hacks of the Julia generic_lu source. I've used
# Polyester.jl to thread them and done some tweaking. On
# my Mac M2 Pro with 8 performace cores I'm seeing a 10x speedup
# over where I was before and seem to be using the hardware support
# for half precision as well as I can. I am still 5x slower than
# the LAPACK double precision LU, so there's a factor of 20 out there
# somewhere.

# The solvers are mpgeslir (iterative refinement) and mpgmir (IR-GMRES).
# I'm not working on more than that right now. I have overloaded
# \ with these so you should not have to call them directly unless
# you are looking at iteration statistics

#
# Each MPArray data structure comes with a structure to store a factorization.
# The differences are whether one does on-the-fly interprecision transfers
# of not. For plain IR with high=double and low=single, I think the answer 
# is clear (NO) and you should use MPArray with onthefly = false 
# (the default).
# and MPLEFact. If low precision is half, it's not so clear and the 
# documentation has an example to illustrate that.
#
# The factorization structures should be invisible to most people 
# and I may stop exporting them. 
#
# For IR-GMRES, it's more subtle.  The cost of Heavy IR with MPHArray
# and MPGHFact is an extra high precision matrix. If you can afford the 
# storage and communication burden, it's a reasonable thing to do. 
# If you can't, on-the-fly is your only option. The differences in time
# become less significant as the problem size gets large and the O(N^2)
# interprecision transfer cost is completely dominated by the O(N^3) 
# factorization cost.
